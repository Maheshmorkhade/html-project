    <h1>Tiger Reserve Of Maharashtra</h1>
    <p>Maharashtra provides legal protection to its tiger population through six dedicated tiger reserves under the
        precincts of the National Tiger Conservation Authority.[1] under the initiative Project Tiger. These reserves
        cumulatively cover an estimated area of 9,113km2 which is about 3% of the total state area.</p>
    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>Tiger reserves came to be created under the former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi's flagship program Project Tiger.
        It envisioned to create a safe haven for tigers to flourish and receive legal protection against poachers.
        Melghat is the among the first nine tiger reserves to be declared in 1973-74 with Gugamal National Park as its
        core zone along with adjoining Melghat Wildlife Sanctuary and deciduous rich forest zones. Subsequently, over
        the years, five additional reserves were created. Tadoba National Park, formed in 1955, is one of the oldest
        national parks. In 1993 its merge with Andhari Wildlife Sanctuary led to the creation of Tadobo Andhari Tiger
        Reserve.</p>
